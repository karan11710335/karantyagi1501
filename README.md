# Hi, I'm Karan Tyagi 👋🏾‍👨‍💻


I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community, online & offline. Some technologies I enjoy working with include AWS Solution Architect, Docker, Nagios, Puppet, Selenium, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. My interest in the Cloud and Automation led me to contribute in more than 4 projects.
